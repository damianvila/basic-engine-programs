# BASIC programs for the BASIC Engine computer

A collection of silly BASIC programs for the [BASIC Engine](http://basicengine.org/) board.
These programs are designed to be simple and easy to follow, as an educational tool for children.

## What is the BASIC Engine computer?

The [BASIC Engine](https://github.com/uli/basicengine-pcb) is a very low-cost single-board home computer with advanced 2D color graphics and sound capabilities, roughly comparable to late-1980s or early-1990s computers and video game consoles. It can be built at home without special skills or tools and using readily available components for under 10 Euros in parts, or mass-produced for even less.
